## Logistics, Local Transportation and Lodging 

### Information about visas: 

Invitation Letters were already sent to participants who need to apply for visas to travel to Brazil.  If you have not received an invitation letter, please contact us at latampolmeth@gmail.com

### Transportation options in Recife 

Both taxis and ride-sharing services (uber) can be convenient and safe ways to get to and from the airport.

When you arrive at the airport, collect your luggage and proceed to the airport's arrival area. Follow signs for "Desembarque" (Arrivals).

Using Taxis:
- Official Airport Taxis: Upon arriving at the airport, look for official airport taxis. These are typically well-marked and located in designated taxi stands. Avoid accepting rides from individuals who approach you inside the airport, as they might not be legitimate taxi drivers.
- Fare Estimate: Before getting into the taxi, ask the driver for an estimate of the fare to your destination. This can help you avoid any surprises when it comes to the cost.
- Receipts: Request a receipt from the taxi driver, which can be useful for reimbursement if your trip is business-related or for reference in case of any issues.
- Payment Methods: Check with the driver about the accepted payment methods. In Brazil, it's common to pay in cash, but some taxis also accept credit cards. Confirm this beforehand.
- Language Barrier: While some taxi drivers may speak English, it's helpful to have your destination address written down or saved on your phone in Portuguese to ensure a smooth ride.

Using Uber
- Recife's Guararapes-Gilberto Freyre International Airport offers free Wi-Fi for travelers. Connect to the airport's Wi-Fi network to request an Uber. 
- We recommend that participants use Uber VIP or Comfort options to ensure safer and well-maintained vehicles.
